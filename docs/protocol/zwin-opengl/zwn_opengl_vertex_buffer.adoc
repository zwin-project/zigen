== destroy
`request`

Destroy a zwn_opengl_vertex_buffer object.

== attach
`request`

Set a buffer of a vertex buffer. The content of the buffer is double-buffered
state.

The initial contents of a vertex buffer are void; there is no content.
zwn_opengl_vertex_buffer.attach assigns the given buffer as the pending buffer.
zwn_virtual_object.commit makes the pending buffer the new vertex buffer to
be used for the next rendering. After commit, there is no pending buffer until
the next attach.

// TODO: wl_buffer will be replaced with zwn_buffer
Committing a pending buffer allows the compositor to read the content of the
buffer. The compositor may access the content at any time after the
zwn_virtual_object.commit request. When the compositor will not access the
buffer any more, it will send the wl_buffer.release event.
Only after receiving wl_buffer.release, the client may reuse the buffer. A
wl_buffer that has been attached and then replaced by another attach instead of
committed will not receive a release event, and is not used by the compositor.

If a pending buffer has been committed to more than one
zwn_opengl_vertex_buffer, the delivery of wl_buffer.release events becomes
undefined. A well-behaved client should not attach a buffer to more than one
vertex buffer. Instead, clients can attach a vertex buffer to more than one
zwn_opengl_component.

Destroying the wl_buffer after wl_buffer.release does not change the contents
of the vertex buffer. Destroying the wl_buffer before wl_buffer.release
is allowed as long as the underlying buffer storage isn't reused (this can
happen e.g. on client process termination). However, if the client destroys the
wl_buffer before receiving the wl_buffer.release event and mutates the
underlying buffer storage, the contents of the vertex buffer become undefined
immediately.
