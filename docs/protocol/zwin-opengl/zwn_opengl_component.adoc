= zwn_opengl_component

Graphic Pipeline へのひとまとまりの入力を表す interface.
主に Virtual object に描画する内容に関する double-buffered state を更新する。
vertex buffer と shader program が attach され、少なくとも一つ以上の vertex attribute
を持っていて、set_count がされていないと object は render されない。

When clients want to destroy a virtual object, they must destroy the
bound zwn_opengl_component before the virtual object.

== destroy
`request`

Destroy zwn_opengl_component. Objects attached to a zwn_opengl_component will
not be destroyed unless otherwise stated in their interface protocols.

== attach_vertex_buffer
`request`

Attach zwn_opengl_vertex_buffer object to a zwn_opengl_component.
A zwn_opengl_component cannot have more than one vertex buffer, and if another
vertex buffer has already been attached, it will be replaced.

When a client modifies the content of the vertex buffer currently attached,
the client has to attach the vertex buffer to the zwn_opengl_component again to
notify the update.

Whether the vertex buffer is attached or not is double-buffered state.

When the attached vertex buffer is destroyed, the vertex buffer will be
detached immediately, so a well-behaved client should attach a new vertex buffer
and commit the state before destroying the vertex buffer.

== attach_element_array_buffer
`request`

Attach zwn_opengl_element_array_buffer object to a zwn_opengl_component.
A zwn_opengl_component cannot have more than one element array buffer, and if
another element array buffer has already been attached, it will be replaced.

When a zwn_opengl_component has a element array buffer attached, a compositor
constructs a sequence of primitives with the content of the element array
buffer using, e.g. glDrawElements.
If not, a compositor uses attached vertex buffer directly
using, e.g. glDrawArrays.

When a client modifies the content of the element array buffer currently
attached, the client has to attach the element array buffer to the
zwn_opengl_component again to notify the update.

Whether the element array buffer is attached or not is double-buffered state.

When the attached element array buffer is destroyed, the element array buffer
will be detached immediately, so a well-behaved client should attach a new
element array buffer and commit the state before destroying the old buffer.

== attach_shader_program
`request`

Attach zwn_opengl_shader_program object to a zwn_opengl_component.
A zwn_opengl_component cannot have more than one shader program, and if another
shader program has already attached, it will be replaced.

Whether the shader program is attached or not is double-buffered state.

When the attached shader program is destroyed, the shader program will be
detached immediately, so a well-behaved client should attach a new shader
program and commit the state before destroying the shader program.

== attach_texture
`request`

Attach zwn_opengl_texture object to a zwn_opengl_component.
A zwn_opengl_component cannot have more than one texture, and if another
texture has already been attached, it will be replaced.

When a client modifies the content of the texture currently attached, the
client has to attach the texture to the zwn_opengl_component again to notify
the update.

Whether the texture is attached or not is double-buffered state.

When the attached texture is destroyed, the texture will be detached
immediately, so a well-behaved client should attach a new texture and commit the
state before destroying the texture.

== add_vertex_attribute
`request`

Add vertex attribute information to a zwn_opengl_component's pending state.
Clients can add multiple vertex attributes to the pending state, and these
attributes will be applied atomically when committed. After the commit, the
pending state regarding vertex attributes will be cleared.

The vertex attributes a zwn_opengl_component has are double-buffered state.

Please see the specification of OpenGL `glVertexAttribPointer` for more
information.

== clear_vertex_attribute
`request`

Clear the vertex attributes a zwn_opengl_component has.
The vertex attributes a zwn_opengl_component has are double-buffered state.

== set_topology
`request`

Set topology mode for rendering. The topology mode is double-buffered state.
A compositor has a default value "GL_LINES".

Please see the specification of OpenGL `glDrawArrays` or `glDrawElements` for more
information.

== set_min
`request`

Specifies the starting index in the enabled arrays.

When clients use this request with an element array buffer, this specifies the
staring point of the element array buffer in byte.

A compositor has a default value 0. This value is double-buffered state.

// this value will also be used for glDrawRangeElements in the future.

== set_count
`request`

Specify the number of elements to be rendered.
A compositor has a default value 0. This value is double-buffered state.

// this value will also be used for glDrawElements in the future.
