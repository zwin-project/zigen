== destroy
`request`

Destroy a zwn_opengl_texture object.

== attach_2d
`request`

Set a buffer of a texture of 2d. The content of the buffer is double-buffered
state.

The initial contents of a texture are void; there is no content.
zwn_opengl_texture.attach_2d assigns the given buffer as the pending buffer.
zwn_virtual_object.commit makes the pending buffer the new texture to be used
for the next rendering. After commit, there is no pending buffer until the next
attach.
// TODO: zwn_opengl_texture has only one pending buffer and attach_1d and
// attach_3d requests in the future may set the pending buffer replacing the
// buffer that has been attached with this request.

// TODO: wl_buffer will be replaced with zwn_buffer
Committing a pending buffer allows the compositor to read the content of the
buffer. The compositor may access the content at any time after the
zwn_virtual_object.commit request. When the compositor will not access the
buffer any more, it will send the wl_buffer.release event.
Only after receiving wl_buffer.release, the client may reuse the buffer. A
wl_buffer that has been attached and then replaced by another attach instead of
committed will not receive a release event, and is not used by the compositor.

If a pending buffer has been committed to more than one
zwn_opengl_texture, the delivery of wl_buffer.release events becomes undefined.
A well-behaved client should not attach a buffer to more than one texture.
Instead, clients can attach a texture to more than one zwn_opengl_component.

Destroying the wl_buffer after wl_buffer.release does not change the contents of
the texture. Destroying the wl_buffer before wl_buffer.release is allowed as
long as the underlying buffer storage isn't reused (this can happen e.g. on
client process termination). However, if the client destroys the wl_buffer
before receiving the wl_buffer.release event and mutates the underlying buffer
storage, the texture contents become undefined immediately.
