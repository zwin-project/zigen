= zwn_shell

The zwn_shell interface is exposed as a global object enabling clients to turn
their zwn_virtual_objects into cuboid windows. It defines the basic
functionality needed for clients and the compositor to create cuboid windows
that can be dragged, resized, rotated, etc, as well as transient cuboid windows
such as preview objects during drag & drop action.

== destroy
`request`

Destroy this zwn_shell object.

Destroying a bound zwn_shell object while there are virtual object role objects
still alive created by this zwn_shell object instance is illegal and will result
in zwn_shell.defunct_virtual_object error.

== get_cuboid_window
`request`

This creates a zwn_cuboid_window object for the given zwn_virtual_object and
gives the cuboid window role to the virtual object.

The compositor uses the half_size argument as a hint of the size of a new cuboid
window. The client should not rely on the compositor to obey the value. The
compositor may decide to ignore the value.
The same applies to the quaternion.

The half_size argument should be a float array of size 3, and each float value
should be greater than zero. Otherwise, the request will be an
invalid_cuboid_window_size error.
