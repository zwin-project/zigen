= zwn_cuboid_window

This interface defines a zwn_cuboid_window role which gives an oriented bounding
box to a virtual object. We call the OBB "Cuboid Window". The center of a cuboid
window matches the origin of its virtual-object-local coordinate system.
The compositor manages model matrices of virtual objects and places cuboid
windows in the global space. The model matrices of cuboid-window-role virtual
objects do only translation, and any request which scale or rotate the model
matrices does not exist.

The cuboid window will be represented by `half_size` (vec3) and `quaternion`
(vec4). Note that the center of the cuboid window matches the origin of its
virtual-objet-local-coordinates. Therefore we can represent the OBB with these
two parameters.

Clients can draw content of the virtual object with cuboid window role but only
within the cuboid window. The behavior when clients draw some objects outside
the cuboid window is undefined.

When a ray intersects with a cuboid window, the ray is regarded as intersected
with the associated virtual object.

zwn_cuboid_window provides protocols for user interactions such as move and
resize of the cuboid window in the global space.

== destroy
`request`

Delete the cuboid window and invalidates its object ID.

== ack_configure
`request`

When a configure event is received, if a client commits the virtual object in
response to the configure event, then the client must make an ack_configure
request sometime before the commit request, passing along the serial of the
configure event.

The compositor then understand that the client will draw objects in response to
the configure event corresponding to the serial argument from the next commit.

If the client receives multiple configure events before it can respond to one,
it only has to ack the last configure event.

A client is not required to commit immediately after sending an ack_configure
request - it may even ack_configure several times before its next commit.

A client may send multiple ack_configure requests before committing, but only
the last request sent before a commit indicates which configure event the
client really is responding to.

|serial
|the serial from the configure event

== configure
`event`

This configure event asks the client to resize and rotate its cuboid window.
The half_size argument is a float vector of size 3, and each float value is
greater than zero.
The quaternion argument is a float vector of size 4, and it's normalized.

Clients should arrange their virtual object for the new size, and then send an
ack_configure request with the serial sent in this configure event at some
point before committing the new virtual object.

If the client receives multiple configure events before it can respond to one,
it is free to discard all but the last event it received.

|half size

|quaternion
|The quaternion of the cuboid window (vec4) {{x, y, z}, w}
|===

== move
`request`

Start an interactive, user-driven move of the virtual object.

The request must be used in response to some sort of user action like a button
press or key press. The passed serial is used to determine the type of
interactive move.

The server may ignore move requests depending on the state of the virtual
object, or if the passed serial is no longer valid.

If triggered, the virtual object will lose the focus of the device used for the
move. It is up to the compositor to visually indicate that the move is taking
place. The is no guarantee that the device focus will return when the move is
completed.
