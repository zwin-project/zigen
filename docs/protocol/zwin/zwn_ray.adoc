= zwn_ray

The zwn_ray interface represents a 3D input device which has a origin point and
direction such as 6DoF input device.

The zwn_ray interface generate motion, enter and leave events for the virtual
object that the ray intersects, and button and axis events for button presses,
button releases and scrolling.

The way to judge the ray intersection should be defined in the role of
zwn_virtual_object. Ray will not intersect with virtual object without
a role or with a role which has no definition regarding the ray intersection.

== enter
`event`

Notification that this seat's ray is focused on a certain virtual object

The origin and direction arguments must be float vectors of size 3, and the
direction vector must be normalized.

// TODO: Add description which correspond to the usage of set_cursor in wl_pointer

|arg|description

|serial
|serial number of the enter event

|virtual_object
|virtual object intersected by the ray

|origin
|ray origin in the virtual-object-local coordinate system (vec3)

|direction
|ray direction in the virtual-object-local coordinate system (vec3 normalized).

== leave
`event`

Notification that his seat's ray is no longer focused on a certain virtual
object.

|===
|arg|description

|serial
|serial number of the leave event

|virtual_object
|virtual object left by the ray
|===

== motion
`event`

Notification of ray position change. The arguments ray_origin and ray_direction
are described in the virtual-object-local coordinate system.

The origin and direction arguments must be float vectors of size 3, and the
direction vector must be normalized.

|arg|description

|time
|timestamp with millisecond granularity

|origin
|ray origin in the virtual-object-local coordinate system (vec3)

|direction
|ray direction in the virtual-object-local coordinate system (vec3 normalized)

|released
|the button is not pressed

|pressed
|the button is pressed
|===

== button
`event`

Notification that a button attached to the ray device is clicked or released.

The button argument is a button code as defined in the Linux kernel's
linux/input-event-codes.h header file, e.g. BTN_LEFT.

Any 16-bit button code value is reserved for future additions to the kernel's
event code list. All other button codes above 0xFFFF are currently undefined
but may be used in future version of this protocol.

|===
|arg|description

|serial
|serial number of the button event

|time
|timestamp with millisecond granularity, with an undefined base

|button
|button that produced the event

|state
|physical state of the button
|===

== release

Using this request, a client can tell the server that it is not going to use
the ray object anymore.
