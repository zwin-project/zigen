|xkb_v1
|libxkbcommon compatible; to determine the xkb keycode, clients must add 8 to the key event keycode
|===

== keymap
`event`

This event provides a file descriptor to the client which can be memory-mapped
in read-only mode to provide a keyboard mapping description.

The fd must be mapped with MAP_PRIVATE by the recipient, as MAP_SHARED may fail.

== key
`event`

A key was pressed or released.
The time argument is a timestamp with millisecond granularity, with an

The key is a platform-specific key code that can be interpreted by feeding it
to the keyboard mapping (see the keymap event).

It this event produces a change in modifiers, then the resulting
zwn_keyboard.modifiers event must be sent after this event.

|===
|arg|description

|serial
|serial number of the key event

|time
|timestamp with millisecond granularity

|key
|key that produced the event

|state
|physical state of the key
