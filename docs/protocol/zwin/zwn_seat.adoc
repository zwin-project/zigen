== capabilities
`event`

This is emitted whenever a seat gains or loses the ray or keyboard
capabilities. The argument is a capability enum containing the
complete set of capabilities this seat has.

When the ray capability is added, a client may create a zwn_ray object
using the zwn_seat.get_ray request. This object will receive ray events
until the capability is removed in the future.

When the ray capability is removed, a client should destroy the zwn_ray object
associated with the seat where the capability was removed, using the
zwn_ray.release request. No further ray events will be received on
these objects even if the seat regains the ray capability.

The above behavior also applies to zwn_keyboard with the keyboard capability.

== get_ray
`request`

The ID provided will be initialized to the zwn_ray interface for this seat.

This request only takes effect if the seat has the ray capability, or has had
the ray capability in the past. It is a protocol violation to issue this
request on a seat that has never had the ray capability. The missing_capability
error will be sent in this case.

== get_keyboard
`request`

The ID provided will be initialized to the zwn_keyboard interface for this
seat.

This request only takes effect if ths seat has the keyboard capability, or has
had the keyboard in the past. It is a protocol violation to issue this
request on a seat that has never had the keyboard capability. The
missing_capability error will be sent in this case.

== release
`request`

Using this request, a client can tell the server that it is not going to
use the seat object anymore.
